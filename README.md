CoachGPT is a CLI that pulls runs from Strava and generates a detailed analysis including pace, heart rate zones, elevation, and splits - perfect for pasting into ChatGPT for coaching feedback.

## Features

- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Fetches your latest run or a specific activity from Strava
- üìä Analyzes heart rate zones, pace, and elevation data
- üìà Provides detailed split and lap breakdowns
- üíæ Intelligent caching with ETag support for efficient API usage
- üîê Secure OAuth2 authentication with token refresh
- üìã Generates formatted markdown ready for AI analysis
